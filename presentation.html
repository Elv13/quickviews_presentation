            <section><p>Back in the QtWidgets days, if you had modelized data, you could tell
management:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, I can display it with Qt</li>
<li>Yes, I can display it, but I need to implement a thing called
  QtWidgets QAbstractItemView</li>
</ul>
<h4>Now we have</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yes, the ListView/GridView/TableView will work</li>
<li>Sorry, Qt doesn't allow to display our data, implementing new views is
  expensive, let use something else.</li>
<li>Lets use the Web stack, it can do everything</li>
</ul>
<h4>Worst still</h4>
<p>If you had old, complex and battle tested models and a QtWidgets based GUI,
you are stuck with a <em>legacy</em> and non-mobile-friendly GUI stack <strong>forever</strong>.</p>
<p>I see this as a critical issue that prevents current/former customers to use
the Qt technologies again. It's bad for business, bad for consultants and only
profit the Web stack, because that's what they will switch to.</p></section>

            <section><p>The old QtWidgets design scaled well because it was simple. You had a single
"delegate" instance with a QPainter function and the metadata necessary to
paint at the right position. The size hints were previously determined. Rather
than after the fact like QML.</p>
<p>QtQuick uses "declarative" widgets. They are QObjects and created by the engine
to turn the intent into a GUI visual. It also uses the GPU much more often than
QtWidgets and tracks many more buffers and objects sent between the CPU and GPU.
These implementation details make using a single instance painted multiple time
impractical.</p>
<p>QtQuick2.ListView and GridView sidestep this problem by ignoring it.
However it restricts them to the smallest possible subset of the model topology:
lists. While tables are quite well implemented in Qt 5.12, it took a decade and
now we have the two simplest model typologies. This wont scale to trees very
well.</p></section>

            <section><p>The current upstream view implementation was "rushed" when QML was first
written as time-to-market was important to stay competitive. Those views at the
time targeted mobile and embedded and ignored the more complex desktop use
cases. This made sense from a business point of view and I would have taken
the same decision, but now there is a technical debt to repay.</p>
<p>The current view implementation do too many things each classes and they are
tangled in a web of low level private APIs.</p>
<p>This design is and was always faster to develop than taking an overly general
conceptual approach to solve the problem. However it isn't flexible enough to
be adapter to use cases that were not taken into account when the view was
coded.</p></section>

<li>Some views have slow corner cases, but they are in fact impossible to
  optimize due to implementation details.</li>

<li>A lot of Qt5 QML components rely on "private" and "QML only" APIs
  like the QQuickAnchors and internal QtQuick "V4" engine data types</li>
<li>Existing Qt customers codebase designed for QtWidgets don't fully map into
  the current QtQuick.Views<ul>
<li>They might leave the Qt ecosystem if they can't re-use their past
  investment.</li>

            <section><p>In the last year I designed a generic framework to implement custom views for
Qt models. Since September 1, I worked full time implementing it.</p>
<p>This work has been sponsored by BlueSystems. It is part of a larger body of work
allow existing Qt/KDE apps to be ported from QtWidgets to QtQuick without major
rewrites. This is important for BlueSystems projects such as Plasma Mobile and
other projects under NDA.</p>
<p>Since from its inception it duplicates a lot of components provided by QtQuick
itself, we should investigate what can be shared.</p>
<p>Even if this ends up a research project and is never upstreamed, there is
lessons to be learned and maybe some optimizations strategies can make their
way upstream.</p></section>

<li>All these tiny building blocks and indirection can make things slower: I
  know. If it becomes a bottleneck, then there is known code transformation
  to inline much of it. It makes the code less readable so I don't plan to do
  this until its a necessity</li>
<li>CPU are good at branch prediction, your code would have been good on an
  in-order CPU but that era is long gone: I know. I made the choice of using
  this type of design to minimize the number of "if" (branch) in the code
  to make it readable and provable. The downside of reducing the number of
  branch in favor of vTables and callmap is that CPU sucks at them.</li>
<li>The concept of converging toward correctness often cause many iterations
  of nonsense: True. This part of the design exist because I failed to make
  the paging system work. It was too much for me and progress was too slow.
  Once the framework is feature complete, this can be revisited without
  breaking the API.</li>
<li>X or Y is slow: See the planned optimization list. The current state is
  fast enough to ship and faster than loading everything ahead of time. Future
  iterations can implement various optimizations.</li>
<li>You have some API or mode but they don't work: Some code has been written for
  feature whose design is final. Yet, if I have no use for them and no tests,
  then the code is most probably incomplete. It's partially implemented where
  it was trivial to do so when I wrote the code around it. Everything regarding
  tables and exotic size hint strategies are prime examples.</li>

            <section><p><strong>Name:</strong> Proxy variant 1 (implemented by this framework)</p>
<p><strong>Automatic:</strong> no</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Create a special proxy model in QML that has access to the
 framework internal APIs so it can generate the size hints and be used
 internally</p>
<p><strong>Usecase:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It's a clean way to emulate the old QtWidgets ::sizeHint() method of the
  delegate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It seems rather a good compromise</li>
<li>Support all view features</li>
<li>Re-use the context optimizations introduced earlier</li>
<li>Uses JavaScript expressions and feel very natural in QML</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requires access to private APIs</li>
<li>Proxy models are not the most efficient models</li>
<li>Either need to upstream my context optimizations or refactor the QtQuick own
  context optimizations to be mutualized between the proxy and the view.</li>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> A proxy model implemented in QML based on the design of the

<p><strong>Usecase:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Same as above</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No C++ required</li>
<li>Can use declarative objects to build rules that can then be used from C++
  without round trips in QML</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It's more complex to use than variant one</li>
<li>It feels a bit less native than "normal" QML expressions</li>
<li>If it uses RegEx, then it's error prone, slow and limited to string roles</li>

            <section><p><strong>Name:</strong> Proxy variant 4</p>
<p><strong>Automatic:</strong> no</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Create an implementation that supports variant 1, 2 and 3 and
 let the developer decides what fit their use case best</p>
<p><strong>Usecase:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Same as above</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More choice</li>
<li>Maybe a bit more future proof than putting all eggs in the same basket</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It's more complex to implement</li>
<li>Either need to upstream my context optimizations or refactor the QtQuick own
  context optimizations to be mutualized between the proxy and the view.</li>
</ul>

mentionned in the "status" section below, there is a lot of half-implemented
